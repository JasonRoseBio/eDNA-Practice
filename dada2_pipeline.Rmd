This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dada2)
```
#Read in fastq files, getting matched lists of forward and reverse reads.
```{r}
#forward and reverse file names have pattern _pass_1.fastq.gz and _pass_2.fastq.gz
fnFs <- sort(list.files("/Users/jay/Desktop/eDNA_practice/fastq", pattern="_pass_1.fastq", full.names = TRUE))
fnRs <- sort(list.files("/Users/jay/Desktop/eDNA_practice/fastq", pattern="_pass_2.fastq", full.names = TRUE))
sample.names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(fnFs), "_"), `[`,1)
```
#Visualizing quality profiles (Will try 200 for forward and 150-160 for reverse)
```{r}
plotQualityProfile(fnRs[15:19])
```
# Assigning filenames to filtered fastq files and placing in subdirectory
```{r}
filtFs <- file.path("/Users/jay/Desktop/eDNA_practice/fastq/filtered", "filtered", paste0(sample.names, "_F_filt.fastq.gz"))
filtRs <- file.path("/Users/jay/Desktop/eDNA_practice/fastq/filtered", "filtered", paste0(sample.names, "_R_filt.fastq.gz"))
names(filtFs) <- sample.names
names(filtRs) <- sample.names
out <- filterAndTrim(fnFs, filtFs, fnRs, filtRs, truncLen = c(200,160),
                     maxN = 0, maxEE = c(2,2), truncQ = 2, rm.phix = TRUE,
                     compress=TRUE, multithread = TRUE)
head(out)
```








Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
